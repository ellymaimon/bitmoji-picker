# Bitmoji Tutorial

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizes [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) as its database and [SnapKit](https://kit.snapchat.com/portal/apps) to implement the Bitmoji Sticker Picker.

## Running the Project

To run this project, please add a _.env.local_ file to the root folder of the repository and add the following keys: 
- `REACT_APP_DB_KEY`
- `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`
- `REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL`

The value of the DB key will be that generated by Fauna for your own database. Please ensure that the database collection is called "bitmojis", or update the code to reflect the name of your database collection.

The value of the client ID and redirect URL keys will be acquired from your own [SnapKit](https://kit.snapchat.com/portal/apps) application page in the "Development Environment" and "Redirect URLs" respectively.

Once you have added the environment file and keys, run the following script:

```
npm run start
```

and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
